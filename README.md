# Vector Representation to generate reverse polish notation
About P code machine: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-code_machine <br>
## Input
The input of the binary tree in vector representation is done via file
text and is considered to be formatted correctly.
The positions that are not occupied in the tree / vector are represented
by the character 'X' (ma√∫sculo) to facilitate the process.
The maximum size that this implementation supports is 30 characters.
The reverse Polish notation is generated from a is text file and
it is considered to be properly formatted.
The input of the P code instructions is done inside the code itself from
of the incoming Polish notation.

## Output
To visualize the result in the execution of the source code, just execute it
and make sure the input files are present.
At the output of the p-code statements the null / zero state is not considered
where the battery is completely empty.
The reverse polynomial notation being analyzed in the p-code is
printed at the beginning of the execution and its result will always be
top of the final stack.
